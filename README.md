# Purpose
Most documentation generators rely on annotated comments or specially formatted blocks. Which makes your code look like something a machine might spew out.
A better way is to comment your code the way you normally do but with proper grammar, pass it through the docs phase and voila, you have clean code and accurate documentation.
